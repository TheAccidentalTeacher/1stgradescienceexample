## Instructional Approach - Oklahoma Guidance

Oklahoma emphasizes **phenomenon-based learning:**
- Start with observable events that engage students
- Students figure out explanations through investigation
- Three dimensions (SEP, DCI, CCC) integrated in every lesson
- Student-centered, hands-on, inquiry-based
- Real-world connections and applications

**Assessment Focus:**
- Performance tasks (not just multiple choice)
- Students demonstrate understanding by doing science
- Evidence of three-dimensional learning
- OSTP (Oklahoma School Testing Program) tests science in grades 5, 8, and 11

## Important Notes for Homeschool Setting

### **Freedom in Implementation:**
✅ **Standards DO:**
- Define what students should know and be able to do
- Set grade-level expectations
- Ensure students are prepared for future learning

❌ **Standards DO NOT:**
- Dictate HOW to teach
- Require specific curriculum materials
- Mandate specific scope and sequence
- Limit advanced learning beyond standards
- Prescribe interventions for below-grade-level students

### **Homeschool Flexibility:**
As a homeschool family, you have complete freedom to:
- Teach standards in any order
- Use any materials or curriculum
- Add religious/worldview perspectives (like YEC)
- Adapt for Bobby's specific learning needs
- Go deeper into topics of interest
- Spend more or less time on any topic

**The curriculum you're building meets Oklahoma standards PLUS adds:**
- Young Earth Creation perspective
- Biblical integration throughout
- Accommodations for Bobby's reading level
- Interest-based engagement (dinosaurs, trucks)
- Character growth opportunities (bugs)

## Young Earth Creation Adaptations

### **Where YEC Worldview Applies:**

**Standards that need YEC perspective:**

1. **1.ESS1.1 & 1.ESS1.2** (Sun, Moon, Stars, Seasons)
   - **Standard approach:** Observable patterns, no age implications
   - **YEC addition:** God created these on Day 4 to mark times and seasons (Genesis 1:14-19)
   - **No conflict:** Observing patterns doesn't contradict YEC

2. **1.LS3.1** (Offspring similar to parents)
   - **Standard approach:** Variation within species
   - **YEC addition:** Created kinds reproduce after their kind (Genesis 1:24-25)
   - **Alignment:** This actually supports YEC - variation within kinds, not evolution

3. **1.LS1.1 & 1.LS1.2** (Animal structures and behaviors)
   - **Standard approach:** How structures help survival
   - **YEC addition:** God designed each creature with purpose (Psalm 104)
   - **No conflict:** Design perspective enhances standard

4. **1.ESS3.1** (Human impact on environment)
   - **Standard approach:** Humans affect environment
   - **YEC addition:** God gave humans stewardship responsibility (Genesis 1:28, 2:15)
   - **Alignment:** Supports and deepens the standard

**Standards with no worldview conflict:**
- All Physical Science standards (PS4.1-4) - light and sound are observable
- Engineering standards (K-2.ETS1.1-3) - design process is universal
