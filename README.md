## Course Philosophy

This curriculum is designed for a Christian homeschool environment, presenting science through a **Young Earth Creationism (YEC)** worldview. Every lesson integrates:

1. **Biblical Foundation** - Scripture references (ESV) tied to each concept
2. **Oklahoma Science Standards** - Aligned with state requirements for 1st grade
3. **God's Design** - Emphasis on the Creator's purpose and design
4. **Observation & Wonder** - Encouraging curiosity about God's creation

## Oklahoma 1st Grade Science Standards Alignment

This curriculum addresses the **2020 Oklahoma Academic Standards for Science (OAS-S)** for 1st Grade. Oklahoma's standards are based on Next Generation Science Standards but customized for Oklahoma students.

### **Physical Science: Waves (Light & Sound)**
- **1.PS4.1**: Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrating materials can make sound and that sound can make materials vibrate
- **1.PS4.2**: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that objects can be seen only when illuminated
- **1.PS4.3**: Plan and conduct an investigation to determine the effect of placing objects made with different materials in the path of a beam of light
- **1.PS4.4**: Use tools and materials to design and build a device that uses light or sound to solve the problem of communicating over a distance*

### **Life Science: Structures, Processes & Heredity**
- **1.LS1.1**: Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs*
- **1.LS1.2**: Obtain information from media or text to determine patterns in the behavior of parents and offspring that help offspring survive
- **1.LS3.1**: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that young plants and animals are like, but not exactly like, their parents

### **Earth & Space Science: Patterns & Human Impact**
- **1.ESS1.1**: Use observations of the sun, moon, and stars to describe patterns that can be predicted
- **1.ESS1.2**: Make observations at different times of the year to relate the amount of daylight and relative temperature to the time of year
- **1.ESS3.1**: Communicate solutions that will reduce the impact of humans on the land, water, air, and/or other living things in the local environment*

### **Engineering, Technology & Applications (K-2)**
- **K-2.ETS1.1**: Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change; define a simple problem that can be solved through development of a new or improved object or tool
- **K-2.ETS1.2**: Develop a simple sketch, drawing, or physical model to illustrate how the shape of an object helps it function as needed to solve a problem
- **K-2.ETS1.3**: Analyze data from tests of two objects designed to solve the same problem to compare strengths and weaknesses of how each performs

**Note:** *Asterisk indicates standards that incorporate engineering practices into science content

**Total Coverage:** 13 Performance Expectations (10 grade-specific + 3 K-2 engineering standards)

## Visual Resources Strategy

Given Bobby's reading level and need for visual learning:

### **Image Sources:**
1. **AI-Generated Images** (Using your API keys)
   - Sonnet (Claude): Educational diagrams, concept illustrations
   - DALL-E (OpenAI): Realistic photos, scenes, nature images
   - Gemini (Google): Additional variety, backup option

2. **Free Stock Photos**
   - Unsplash, Pexels (Nature, animals, machines)
   
3. **Custom Illustrations**
   - Simple drawings for each lesson
   - Comic-style sequences for processes
   - Labeled diagrams with minimal text

### **Image Guidelines:**
- Every page has at least one large image
- Real photographs preferred for animals, machines, nature
- AI-generated for biblical scenes, dinosaurs with people, creation week
- Maximum 10-15 words per page
- Word banks with picture supports

---

## Assessment Methods

**Informal assessment through:**
- Verbal questioning during lessons
- Observation during activities
- Drawing/coloring pages showing comprehension
- Show-and-tell presentations to family
- "Can you teach this to your stuffed animals?" activities
- Photo documentation of projects
- Weekly nature journal (mostly pictures Bobby draws)

**No formal tests** - Focus on wonder, curiosity, and building knowledge foundation

---

## Materials Needed

### **General Supplies:**
- Construction paper, crayons, markers
- Glue, scissors (safety)
- Magnifying glass
- Flashlight
- Ball, toy cars, ramps (for physics)
- Seeds, soil, small pots
- Bug observation container (breathable)
- Toy dinosaurs, toy trucks

### **Books:**
- ESV Children's Bible or ESV Story Bible
- Creation-focused picture books
- Dinosaur books (from YEC perspective)

### **Digital:**
- Tablet/computer for viewing images
- Printer for worksheets and images
- AI image generation access

---

## Schedule Recommendation

**3-4 days per week, 45-60 minutes per session**

- Monday: New lesson introduction
- Wednesday: Hands-on activity
- Friday: Review and nature observation

**Flexible pacing:** Some topics may take 1 week, others may take 2-3 weeks depending on Bobby's interest and engagement.

## Parent Notes

### **Working with Bobby's Energy:**
- Start with movement activity to get wiggles out
- Build in "truck breaks" - let him play with trucks for 3-5 minutes
- Use outdoor time whenever possible
- Let him handle objects, touch textures
- Channel energy into activities (jumping, building, digging)

### **Building Reading Skills:**
- Point to words as you read
- Use same vocabulary words repeatedly
- Create picture-word cards
- Let Bobby "read" by describing images
- Celebrate small reading successes

### **Addressing Bug Aversion:**
- Start with pictures only
- Move to videos (safe distance)
- Eventually progress to observation containers
- Never force, but gently encourage
- Emphasize "brave explorer" identity
- Connect to brave Bible characters

### **Reinforcing YEC Worldview:**
- Consistently refer to "when God made..." not "millions of years ago"
- Use terms like "created kinds" instead of "evolution"
- Connect fossils to the Flood
- Emphasize humans and dinosaurs together
- Reference Biblical timeline (approx. 6,000 years)
