        text: 'On Day 3 of Creation Week, God said, "Let the dry land appear!" Suddenly, land rose up from the water—mountains, hills, valleys, and plains. God created all the rocks and soil that make up the ground we walk on. Some rocks are as big as houses (boulders), and some are as tiny as grains of sand!'

        text: 'The Bible talks about rocks a lot! Jesus is called the "Rock" because He is strong and never changes. We\'re told to build our lives on the solid rock of Jesus and His teachings, not on sandy ground that shifts. Even rocks teach us about God\'s character!'

      {
        type: 'explanation',
        text: 'Soil is different from rocks. Soil is made when rocks break down into tiny pieces over time (from water, wind, and weather). Soil also has decomposed plants, minerals, air, and water mixed in. This makes it perfect for plants to grow! God designed soil to give plants nutrients, hold them steady, and store water for their roots.'

        type: 'key-point',
        text: '🌱 Important: Without soil, we couldn\'t grow food! Plants need soil to anchor their roots, get water, and absorb nutrients. Healthy soil is dark and crumbly. God designed soil to be a perfect growing environment for the plants He created on Day 3!'
      },
      {
        type: 'explanation',
        text: 'Many people think rocks formed over millions of years, but the Bible tells us God created them instantly on Day 3! The Great Flood in Noah\'s time also changed the earth dramatically—breaking and moving rocks, forming mountains, and laying down layers quickly. The rocks we see today show evidence of God\'s powerful creation and the judgment of the Flood.'
